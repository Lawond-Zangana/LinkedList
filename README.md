# CSE 12 PA3: Doubly Linked List
This code implements a generic doubly linked list structure similar to Javaâ€™s LinkedList, allowing for the storage and manipulation of elements. The assignment involves writing the functionality to add, remove, and retrieve elements while ensuring the list behaves correctly through a series of specified operations. Additionally, it requires creating JUnit tests to validate the implementation, ensuring robustness by checking edge cases and handling errors appropriately, such as null entries or out-of-bounds indices. The project emphasizes understanding linked list mechanics and utilizing effective testing practices to ensure reliability in the data structure's operations.
